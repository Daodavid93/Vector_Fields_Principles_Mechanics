# Mechanics principle .Visualising and explanations 
## represents and implements  of Leap Frog integrations 
### The law of conservation of energy math investigation,python implementation and  visualisations


##### Solving of the system non-linear differential equations using LeapFrog algorithm.So we will able to to calculate the body's motion according second principle of mechanics We will visualize the motions by Python lib pyplot,thus we will attain more understanding of what is vector field ,the innitial values ploblems and so on.In addition we will show the law of conservation of energy
